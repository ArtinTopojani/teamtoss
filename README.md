# 🎮 Team Toss & Kiting Practice

A web-based tool that generates teams with a **secret twist** and lets you warm up your League mechanics while you wait.

## 🚀 Team Generator (The Main Tool)

This tool appears to assign players randomly to teams, BUT it can secretly keep two specific players together.

### How to Use

1. Go to: **https://artintopojani.github.io/teamtoss/**
2. Enter player names (one per line or separated by commas).
3. Click **Generate Teams**.
4. Behind the scenes, pre-configured names will always end up on the same team—while everything else looks completely random.

### 🤫 The "Rigged" Feature

The hidden feature in the **Terms & Conditions** section ensures that **two specified players** are always placed on the same team. Perfect for ensuring you play with your duo, even in a "random" lobby.
